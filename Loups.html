				<li>
					<span>Assignment Statement Considered Harmfull.</span>
					Pervasive mutable state make programs more difficult to deal with. While this is old news, most programmers don't know or don't care. It's a pitty, because <span>simple remedies</span> exist.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>Defining Syntactiac Sugar.</span> I sometimes hear arguments about what is or is not syntactic sugar. This is an attempt at defining it.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>Class-based Programming as Syntactic Sugar.</span> Most of the time, "Object Oriented" actually mean classes. Classes are nothing more than syntactic sugar, at least in statically typed languages such as Java and C++. Sugar is not useless, but seeing past it helps us understand classes better.
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>Taboo "OO".</span> The term "OO" is so overloaded that we should stop using it. Better substitutes are "classes" and "prototypes".
				</li>
				<li>
					<span>How Class based Programming Sucks.</span> Classes are vastly sub-optimal. Functional programming is far better.
